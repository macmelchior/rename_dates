# rename_dates.py
A simple Python script which changes the date in file name from US format (MM-DD-YYYY) to european format (DD-MM-YYYY).

Based on 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' by Al Sweigart, project from chapter 10 (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter10/).

My version raises an exception in case the file does not contain a date and informs the user about incorrect date in the file name.
